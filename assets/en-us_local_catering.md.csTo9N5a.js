It turns out the owner’s wife is from Liaoning, so it was hard for her to hold back.</p><p>This place is a popular spot for team-building, located right across from the school and next to Lost. The menu is quite diverse (a moment of silence for the now-defunct A Long’s BBQ). The quality control is fairly solid, as you can see the staff skewering the ingredients themselves instead of using pre-made materials. The editor enjoys the honey-glazed grilled chicken and cheese sweet potatoes (though I think they might be gone now?), and the dumpling soup is also pretty good. However, the dumplings are just regular frozen ones, so that&#39;s a no-go.</p><p>They’re open until 2:00 AM at the latest, but you can call ahead if you want them to stay open a little longer.</p><h2 id="bnbu-phase-1-phase-2-snack-street-6-10-points" tabindex="-1">BNBU Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2 Snack Street <em>6 / 10 points</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#bnbu-phase-1-phase-2-snack-street-6-10-points" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;BNBU Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2 Snack Street *6 / 10 points*&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It’s like panning for gold in the sand—you can enjoy a good meal here even for a quick bite. The burger stall, where they make fresh burgers and hot dogs on the spot, comes highly recommended! There&#39;s also a hidden gem with steaks, which you can pre-order for a delicious meal.</p><p>Inside Phase 1, there&#39;s an elderly gentleman who makes a really good beef noodle soup. The editor has also had the pleasure of enjoying his &quot;smoked&quot; rationed food. At the same time, there&#39;s a little cocktail shop run by a very chatty owner, and his bartending skills are quite impressive. Many people enjoy sitting there, chatting and sipping drinks.</p><h2 id="wang-jie-s-farmhouse-7-10-points" tabindex="-1">Wang Jie’s Farmhouse <em>7 / 10 points</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#wang-jie-s-farmhouse-7-10-points" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Wang Jie’s Farmhouse *7 / 10 points*&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Address / Price per Person</p><p>No. 4, Lane 2, Huitong Village, Jintong Road, Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai | Around ¥100 per person</p></div><p>A fairly authentic Northeastern-style iron pot stew, located in Huitong Village near BNBU.</p><p>I first tried it before the restaurant moved to Huitong Village, when a senior took me there. Later, I also brought some Northeastern friends, and they really enjoyed it.

Its advantage is the location — right across from the school, so you can drop by anytime. Private rooms are also available. The overall style is rustic farmhouse, which might appeal to traditional Cantonese diners (perhaps?).</p><p>Recommended dishes include free-range chicken and claypot rice, both classic farmhouse flavors!

The Gangwan No.1 location has a more modern Shanghainese-style décor, unlike some other places that still feel like 1990s restaurants, making it a better spot for photos too.</p><p>Their “Yan Du Xian” (pork and bamboo shoot soup) is excellent, especially in winter when you can taste the fresh winter bamboo shoots in the broth. Overall, the dishes are very authentic, though the flavor profile may not suit everyone’s palate.</p>',28)]))}const g=a(n,[["render",i]]);export{d as __pageData,g as default};
