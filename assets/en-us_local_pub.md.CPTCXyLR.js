It’s suitable for satisfying a craving for alcohol or casually having some spirits.</p><p>First, the quality of the drinks and the service are the key standards for judging whether a bar is worth visiting. Lost has no bartenders capable of mixing cocktails, and the base liquors used are of mediocre quality with a very low cost-performance ratio. Secondly, the keg packages sold in Lost are not exactly cheap—around 200 RMB per keg. Buying juice and base liquor separately at the counter is even more expensive, making it better to mix your own drinks in the dorm.</p><p>The food at Lost, although pre-made, is acceptable in quality. However, the chef leaves after 2 a.m. That said, Lost closes very late and will even let you drink until six or seven in the morning, allowing you to sit outside the bar and continue drinking.</p><h2 id="sili-craft-beer-bar-肆礼精酿酒吧-7-10-points" tabindex="-1">Sili Craft Beer Bar (肆礼精酿酒吧) <em>7 / 10 points</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#sili-craft-beer-bar-肆礼精酿酒吧-7-10-points" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sili Craft Beer Bar (肆礼精酿酒吧) *7 / 10 points*&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Business Hours / Address</p><p>No. 1, Huitong Third Alley, Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai</p></div><p>Previously run by two male students from BIT, it was taken over in April 2025 by BNBU students (the handover was simply due to both original owners needing to start internships). It’s relatively close, located in Huitong Village near BNBU.</p><p>Since the author only drank here before the handover, no comments will be made about the current drink quality.</p><p>The bar is located in a heritage-protected building, with tasteful décor.

As of May 2025, when the author last visited, there were already two operating locations. It is named &quot;9 sqm&quot; because the original venue was only 9 square meters in size. The bar is not far—only a 15-minute taxi ride away.</p><p>As a cocktail-focused lounge bar, it has excellent value for money. Average drinks cost between 40-60 RMB. Coming with friends to this small town near the university town is a nice way to relax. The décor leans towards casual home style, and you can also go up to the rooftop terrace for a drink. There is basically no food, so it’s recommended to bring your own late-night snacks.</p><h2 id="typhoon-tavern-kiln-pizza-台风酒馆-窑炉披萨-9-10-points" tabindex="-1">Typhoon Tavern - Kiln Pizza (台风酒馆-窑炉披萨) <em>9 / 10 points</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#typhoon-tavern-kiln-pizza-台风酒馆-窑炉披萨-9-10-points" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Typhoon Tavern - Kiln Pizza (台风酒馆-窑炉披萨) *9 / 10 points*&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Business Hours / Address</p><p>11:00-01:00 | No. 6-101, Tangren Street, Tangle Road, Tangjiawan, Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai</p></div><p>An old establishment in Zhuhai for over ten years, specializing in handmade pizza and craft beer.

Probably only HEY!GO can compete in variety. The kitchen has no partitions, so you can observe the pizza-making process up close.

It’s remote—about 45 minutes by taxi.</p><p>Located on the upper floors of a hotel, the balcony view is spectacular, and the interior design is loaded with European retro style. The clientele is diverse—the author has seen cigar aficionados come here just to enjoy a Cuban cigar alone, and wealthy patrons spend lavishly on a single bottle.</p><h2 id="ydm-yi-di-miao-herbal-tea-ydm医帝庙凉茶-9-10-points" tabindex="-1">YDM Yi Di Miao Herbal Tea (YDM医帝庙凉茶) <em>9 / 10 points</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#ydm-yi-di-miao-herbal-tea-ydm医帝庙凉茶-9-10-points" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;YDM Yi Di Miao Herbal Tea (YDM医帝庙凉茶) *9 / 10 points*&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Business Hours / Address</p><p>19:00-02:00 | No. 78-5, Beishan Zhengjie, Beishan Village, Zhuhai</p></div><p>Its location is very close to HEY!GO, and similarly about 40 minutes by taxi.</p><p>This bar is also renovated from a heritage building and offers cocktails infused with Chinese tea culture—a rarity in China!</p><p>During the day it sells regular tea (though pricey), but the real deal is the cocktails served at night.</p><p>The environment is full of classic Chinese charm, and the atmosphere of Beishan Courtyard adds to YDM’s tea fragrance.</p><h2 id="lanwei-taproom-rating-8-3-10" tabindex="-1">Lanwei Taproom Rating: <em>8.3 / 10</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#lanwei-taproom-rating-8-3-10" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Lanwei Taproom Rating: *8.3 / 10*&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Opening Hours / Address</p><p>18:00-02:00 | No. 104, Xileli, Lane 35, Jinshan Street, Qianshan, Xiangzhou, Zhuhai</p></div><p>Like the previously mentioned Black Dog, this is a craft beer taproom and ranks among the top three craft bars in Zhuhai in the author’s opinion. Unlike Black Dog, Lanwei focuses on imported varieties, including fruit beers, stouts, and high-ABV IPAs. The selection is rich and reasonably priced. Its standout feature is the bar snacks—Thai-style grilled pork neck and grilled prawns, all freshly grilled and generous in portion. The owner is an interesting person, and the bar’s WeChat group is full of enthusiasts sharing food and drinks. Craft beer and food lovers should not miss this spot.</p><p><img src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/PhoenixTechProject/HandbookPicBed/pic/local/pubs/1756461345.jpg" alt="" data-zoomable="true"></p><h2 id="coda-rating-8-5-10" tabindex="-1">CODA Rating: <em>8.5 / 10</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#coda-rating-8-5-10" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;CODA Rating: *8.5 / 10*&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Opening Hours / Address</p><p>20:00-02:00 | Room 12, No. 8, North 3rd Lane, Beishan Main Street, Xiangzhou, Zhuhai</p></div><p>CODA operates as a “Coffee in the Morning, Alcohol at Night” (early C, late A) spot. Perhaps the best cocktail bar in Beishan, its cocktails and premium spirits are priced similarly to YDM. The cocktail menu changes frequently; one season, all cocktails were golden-colored, which was quite interesting. The bar has limited seating, ideal for 2–3 people for a casual drink. In the author’s view, it and YDM each have their own merits—CODA’s mixology skills are higher, while YDM excels in creativity and atmosphere. Recommended to try both when visiting Beishan.</p><p><img src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/PhoenixTechProject/HandbookPicBed/pic/local/pubs/1756461373.jpg" alt="" data-zoomable="true"></p><h2 id="seven-days-coffee-bar-city-balcony-branch-rating-8-0-10" tabindex="-1">Seven Days Coffee.Bar (City Balcony Branch) Rating: <em>8.0 / 10</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#seven-days-coffee-bar-city-balcony-branch-rating-8-0-10" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Seven Days Coffee.Bar (City Balcony Branch) Rating: *8.0 / 10*&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Opening Hours / Address</p><p>10:00-24:00 | North Corner, 3rd Floor, City Balcony, Qilou Zhong Road, Xiangzhou, Zhuhai</p></div><p>A hidden gem of the author, this early C, late A spot serves excellent coffee during the day. The author often buys their cold brew Americano in bulk. The music playlist is pure jazz and hiphop (Kenichiro Nishihara, Nujabes, etc.).</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environment is stunning, located in a small corner of City Balcony mall with a sea view, perfect for dates or casual drinks. The bar also offers classic craft beers (e.g., Belching Beaver), and the cocktail menu is surprisingly creative, with clear labeling of appearance, flavor, and recipe. Users can even customize the base spirit. Unlike generic hybrid bars, this one is thoughtfully curated. Recommended when visiting Sun Moon Bay or Fisher Girl.</p><div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;"><img src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/PhoenixTechProject/HandbookPicBed/pic/local/pubs/1756461379.jpg" width="100" height="100"><img src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/PhoenixTechProject/HandbookPicBed/pic/local/pubs/1756461387.jpg" width="100" height="100"></div><div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;margin-top:10px;"><img src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/PhoenixTechProject/HandbookPicBed/pic/local/pubs/1756461396.png" width="100" height="200"><img src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/PhoenixTechProject/HandbookPicBed/pic/local/pubs/1756461404.jpg" width="100" height="100"></div></div><h2 id="pool-bar-rating-7-0-10" tabindex="-1">Pool Bar Rating: <em>7.0 / 10</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#pool-bar-rating-7-0-10" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pool Bar Rating: *7.0 / 10*&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Opening Hours / Address</p><p>20:00-02:00 | Leshi Cultural Zone, Qianshan, Xiangzhou, Zhuhai</p></div><p>Located in a creative park in Qianshan, the bar is spacious.
